# DS5100-Final-Project
Monte Carlo Final Project

# Project Title
Monte Carlo Simulator.

## Description

Project contains three classes that implement a simple Monte Carlo
simulator(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) using a set
of three related classes — a Die class, a Game class, and an Analyzer
class.

The classes are related in the following way: Game objects are
initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with
a Game object.

In this simulator, a “die” can be any discrete random variable
associated with a stochastic process, such as using a deck of cards,
flipping a coin, rolling an actual die, or speaking a language.
